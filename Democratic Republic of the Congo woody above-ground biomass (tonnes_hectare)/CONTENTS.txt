# Description
Observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer(MODIS) were used in combination with a large data set of Fieldmeasurements to map woody above-ground biomass (AGB) across tropicalAfrica. We generated a best-quality cloud-free mosaic of MODIS satellitereflectance observations for the period 2000-2003 and used a regressiontree model to predict AGB at 1 km resolution. Results based on across-validation approach show that the model explained 82% of thevariance in AGB, with a root mean square error of 50.5 Mg ha-1 for arange of biomass between 0 and 454 Mg ha-1 . Analysis of lidar metricsfrom the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS), which are sensitiveto vegetation structure, indicate that the model successfully capturedthe regional distribution of AGB. The results showed a strong positivecorrelation ( R2 = 0.90) between the GLAS height metrics and predicted AGB.
