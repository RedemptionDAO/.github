# Redemption DAO Database
## This repository is our Redemption DAO's acting database to hold all relevant datasets to support our mission.

## Datasets include MRV data serving as a survey technique to estimate Congo forest's carbon and furthermore environmental importance in order to conduct necessary graphical data analysis to support our bid on the plot auction to create sustainable community land trusts instead of oil drilling projects.
